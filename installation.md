### Installation

jsonstream is released as a Maven-enabled library. You can simply add jsonstream to your 
pom.xml as a dependency:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.itranswarp</groupId>
    <artifactId>jsonstream</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.2</version>
</dependency>
```

jsonstream does not depends on other libraries except commons-logging-api. It is very small and lightweight.
